## Database updater (db_updater.py)

### Operation
The script is designed to make requests to the node at specific intervals `UPDATE_INTERVAL` (currently set to 3 by default).
This script can accept configuration parameters either from environment variables or command-line arguments, with the latter taking precedence.

### Configuration
**Environment Variables**
These are preferred when launching with Docker Compose:
- NODE_IP: The IP address of the node to connect to for database updates.
- NODE_PORT: The port number of the node.
- DATABASE_PATH: The file path to the SQLite database.

**Command-Line Arguments**
These override environment variables if provided:
- -nodeip: The IP address of the node to connect to for database updates.
- -nodeport: The port number of the node.
- -dbpath: The file path to the SQLite database.

**Usage**
  
To run the updater with environment variables, set them in your environment or Docker Compose file:

```shell
# Run in command line
export NODE_IP=192.168.1.1
export NODE_PORT=5000
export DATABASE_PATH='/path/to/database.db'
python3 db_updater.py
```

```yaml
# Launch in Docker compose
services:
  db-updater:
    # Change the path to suitable Docker image
    image: "ghcr.io/icyblob/flask-app:latest"
    volumes:
        # Mount the current folder as folder for saving database. Make sure you mount the same folder with flask-app
      - .:/database
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
    environment:
      - NODE_IP=5.199.134.150 
      - NODE_PORT=31844
      - *common-env
    command: ["python3", "db_updater.py"]
    restart: always
```

To run the updater with command-line arguments:
```shell
python db_updater.py --nodeip '192.168.1.1' --nodeport '8080' --dbpath '/path/to/database.db'
```

Ensure that the quottery_cpp_wrapper is accessible and that the provided IP and port are correct for successful data synchronization.

### Core Functions

#### <u>update_database_with_bets</u>

This function serves as the core component responsible for synchronizing bet data between the node and the database. It performs two primary tasks:

- Data Retrieval: It connects to the node to retrieve the latest bet data and node basic info (currently used for bet fee calculation), utilizing the quottery_cpp_wrapper to ensure accurate and efficient communication.

- Database Update: After fetching the data, the function proceeds to update the database with the new bet information, ensuring that the records are current and reflect the latest state of bets from qubic node.

#### <u>fetch_bets_from_node</u>
Get all details of active bets from node and update them to the database. The bet details including
bet description, option descriptions, list of Oracle Providers and their fees, results if available,
bet status, open/close/end datetime, number of slots taken for each option for each bet, etc.

Along with 
the active bet list fetched from the node, it can also get the tick corresponding
with these bet list to indicate the delay from the node.

**Return**

- List of active bets and details of each active bet.
- Corresponding tick.

#### <u>get_qtry_basic_info_from_node</u>
Get node basic info (node ip, node port, fees, money flow, earned money from quottery, burn amount, game oeprator ID, etc.)

**Return**

Qubic node's basic info

#### <u>update_betting_odds</u>
After getting bet details for each active bet, there might be some new joined bets.
Since the betting odd numbers are calculated from the pool, we need to re-calculate
these numbers each time the active bets are fetched.

#### <u>update_current_total_qus</u>
After getting bet details for each active bet, there might be some new joined bets.
Hence, we need to recalculate the total qus of each active bet by multiplying the amount
of qus per slot and total number of slots per bet.


## Quoterry cpp wrapper (quottery_cpp_wrapper.py)
The quottery_cpp_wrapper class contains the wrapper for calling the C++ function for requesting information from node.

### quottery_cpp_wrapper.get_all_bets(self)
Gets the information of all bet that respond from node

#### Returns:
- sts (int): status of request. 0 is success, otherwise is failure
- list: list of dictionary that contain information about all bet information. If failure, it is empty

### quottery_cpp_wrapper. get_bet_info(self, betId)

Gets the detail of a specific bet and bet option

#### Args:
- betId (int): The ID of the bet
- betOption (int): The option ID of this bet

#### Returns:
- sts (int): status of request. 0 is success, otherwise is failure

### quottery_cpp_wrapper. get_qtry_basic_info(self)

Gets the quottery basic information

#### Returns:
- sts (int): status of request. 0 is success, otherwise is failure
- dict: a dictionary that contain information about quottery basic information. If failure, it is empty
